    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p>
      Sadberry Intermediate School, located in Bryan, Texas, was named in honor
      of O.W. Sadberry Sr., a trailblazing educator and community leader who
      profoundly influenced education and civil rights in the region. O.W.
      Sadberry Sr. served as the principal of Booker T. Washington Elementary
      School, which was historically significant as a school for African
      American students during segregation. He was instrumental in integrating
      faculty and preparing for student desegregation in the late 1960s. Beyond
      his work in education, he supported military families, including the
      Tuskegee Airmen stationed in Bryan, by helping them secure housing during
      an era of widespread racial segregationâ€‹

      The idea to name the school after Sadberry was championed by his son,
      Oliver Wayne Sadberry Jr., a community historian and curator at the Brazos
      Valley African American Museum. He worked with a dedicated committee to
      honor his father's legacy of service and education. The school officially
      opened in August 2023 as part of the Bryan Independent School District and
      currently serves grades 5 and 6. Its mission is rooted in continuing
      Sadberry's legacy of fostering opportunity, equity, and academic
      excellence for all students
